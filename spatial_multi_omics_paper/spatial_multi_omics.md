Each section should have key points, where each needs to be refrained and paraphrased.

## Keywords:

- **Myocardial infarction**: heart attack

- **Transcriptomic**:
study of transcriptome --- complete set of RNA, or expession profiling, as it's a study of expepressions levels

- **Single-cell gene expession**: Process of turning on specific gene to start making messenger RNA

- **Chromatin Accessibility**: ...

- **Spatial Transcriptomic**: ...

- **Myocadium**: Muscular layer of the heart.

- **Isochemic Zone (IZ)**: ...


## Abstract
Key points:
- Incomplete understanding of remodelling processes limits effectiveness of therapies to reduce late-stage mortality
 
- Integrative high-resolution map of human cardiac (heart) remodelling after [myocardial infarction](## "Heart Attack")
