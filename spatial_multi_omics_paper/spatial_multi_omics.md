Each section should have key points, where each needs to be refrained and paraphrased.

## Keywords:

- **Myocardial infarction**: heart attack
- **Single-cell gene expession**: ... 
- **Chromatin Accessibility**: ...
- **Spatial Transcriptomic**: ...
- **Myocadium**: ...


## Abstract
Key points:
- Incomplete understanding of remodelling processes limits effectiveness of therapies to reduce late-stage mortality
 
- Integrative high-resolution map of human cardiac (heart) remodelling after [myocardial infarction](## "Heart Attack")
