# 1 on 1 Meeting Friday, Oct 14, 2022

## Your perception of roles and responsibilities?

Self-motivated and directed role in many cases such that I could conduct any trials/experiments on the issues and task assigned without providing too detailed instructions. Also, having a direct supervisor that I could seek helpregularly.

## What keeps you motivated about your role?

Apply statistical and math methods (that Im familiar with) on GNN to solve biological classification problems. 

## What is a moment of success you had this week?

Reproducing environment in different platform (Windows -> Mac, further to Linux late on) to run the jupyter notebook without any package dependency conflict. 

## Where could your use more support?

Direct messaging on Teams, or Post it as GitHub issue to notify supervisor.

## What are your priorities for the coming week?

Examine the codes in `MOGONET` paper, and reproduce their classification results. Discuss further with Priyanshu upon different sections of `multi_omics`. Moreover, fixing bug of copying/moving folders around on ARC.
