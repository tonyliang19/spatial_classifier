# Multi-Omics Graph cOnvolutional NETworks (MOGONET)

Multi-Omics Graph cOnvolutional NETworks (MOGONET) is a novel integrative method for biomedical classification. It jotly explores omics-specific learning and cross-omics correlation learning for effective multi-omics data classification.

This approaches from different biomedical classification applications using **mRNA** expression data, **DNA** methylation data, and **micoRNA** expresision data. Furthermore, MOGONET can identify important biomarkser from different omics data types related to the investigated biomedical problems.
