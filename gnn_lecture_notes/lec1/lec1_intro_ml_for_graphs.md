## Graphs

Graphs are general language for describing and analyzing entities with relations/ interactions.

Types:

 - Event Graphs
 - Computer Networks (pc - laptop - router - etc..)
 - Disease Pathways (DAXX - ABCB1 - CDKN2A - EGFR - ...)
 - Food Webs (prey_x - predator_y - ...)
 - Particle Networks 
 - Undergound Netwroks (Subway / Skytrain stations)
 - Social Networks
 - ....

Complex domains have a rich <b> relational structure </b>, which can be represented as relational graph.

Graphs are the new frontier of deep learning, as it connect things.

### Networks are complex

- Arbitrary size and complex topological structure (i.e. no spatial locality like grids)

- No fixed node ordering or reference point
- Often dynamic and have multimodal features
